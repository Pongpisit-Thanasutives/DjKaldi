# DjKaldi

I cloned https://github.com/Kitt-AI/snowboy.git and compiled a Python3 wrapper to implement my Chulalongkorn university automatic speech recognition class project for the academic purpose. To visit the official github page of Snowboy, a hotword detection engine, and read how to compile it for certain programming languages, click https://github.com/Kitt-AI/snowboy

In this respository, I already compiled a Python3 wrapper for my DjKaldi application.
